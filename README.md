This library will help to show the polyline in dual color similar as Uber with animation in the demo. 
<br><br>

# Demo

<br><br>


## Dependency

```groovy
App Level:
implementation 'com.github.tintinscorpion:Dual-color-Polyline-Animation:{latest_version}'
```
```groovy
Project Level:
maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
```


## Steps:
Pass the googlemap context and Latlng points stored in arraylist.

``` java
   In Kotlin:

   MapAnimator.animateRoute(googleMap, polyLineList)

   In Java:

   MapAnimator.INSTANCE.animateRoute(googleMap, polyLineList);
```
<br>
polyLineList refers to the List of LatLng, the coordinates which is to be decoded from the directions api of google.



### Additional:
   You can change the color and animation time and the width of the polyline by passing :

   ``` java 

   MapAnimator.setPrimaryLineColor(color)
   MapAnimator.setSecondaryLineColor(color) 
   MapAnimator.setPercentCompletion(@IntegerRes time: Int) default is 2500 //amount of time to draw the initial polyline 
   MapAnimator.setColorFillCompletion(@IntegerRes time: Int) default is 1800 //amount of time to refill the primary color
   MapAnimator.setDelayTime(@IntegerRes time: Int) default is 200 //amount of time for delaying to run the sequenceof animation
   MapAnimator.setPrimaryLineCompletion(@IntegerRes time: Int) default is 2000 //amount of time required for the animation to reach from point A to B
   MapAnimator.setPolylineWidth(width: Float) default is 8f 

   ```
   <br>
   If you are calling these methods, call it before animateRoute() method call else it won't reflect.

   
   
## Note:
   If you are using proguard then, write this in proguard-rules.pro 
   
   ``` java
   //For android studio 4.0 and above- 
   -keepclassmembers class com.logicbeanzs.uberpolylineanimation.* {
     <fields>;
     <init>();
     <methods>;
   }
  

   //For android studio below 4.0-
   -keep class com.logicbeanzs.uberpolylineanimation.**
  ```
